# Cohort[6].Cookbook #
## A Collection of Recipes from TechElevator Cohort[6] in PGH ##

Rule 1: Don't tell anyone about Cookbook.
Rule 2: The Cookbook likes Cookbook, it IS Cookbook.
Rule 3: Forget all the rules.
Rule 4: GitHub uses [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) this might help if you don't know it. I didn't know it before now.

## _Instructions_ ##

Add in any recipes that you would like to add and commit them to the Git.Cohort[6].Cookbook.
I would suggest including Recipe Name, Your Name, Ingredients, Instructions. <- Subject to Change.
I would suggest 1 blank line before and after your addition, to make it more readable.

### _Cooking Hacks_ ###

**Mini Pizzas**
I use flour tortilla shells as pizza crusts. Top with favorite ingredients and back at 400 for about 10 minutes.
Best thing about this, if you use small tortillas, you can make trial pizzas to see if they work. 
I liked a blue cheese and bacon pizza, but probably wouldn't have never tried it on a normal sized crust.
I suggest trying: ranch dressing, Frank's hot sauce, or salsa instead of pizza sauce.
Also, it is fun for kids to make a kid size pizza of their own. They can make it however they want!
